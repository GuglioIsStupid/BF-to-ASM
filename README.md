# BF To ASM

a brainfuck to assembly converter

only supports windows so far... I use nasm+gcc to build and run the output assembly

WILL support linux eventually, I just don't have access to my Linux machine right now

MacOS will NEVER be supported (unless if someone makes a pr for it) because I hate apple and refuse to get a mac device

## Building

Its just cmake. I personally used "Visual Studio 18 2026" as the generator

## Why?
I was learning assembly and got bored,... thats really it lmao

## Known Issues
- for some reason new lines output as a small tiny n?? what the hell
